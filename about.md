Utah County Data Sciency Meetup is a group that provides training and networking to local data science practictioners.  This is means people interested in analysis, mathematics, statitistics, data engineering, and applying these things to full systems are all welcome.

Our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Utah-County-Data-Science-Meetup/) provids a lot of up-to-date information about our events.

You can sign up for our Slack channel [here](utahdata.herokuapp.com).  (It's a hobby-level Heroku app, so it may take a second to spin up.)  The Slack channel is at [utahdata.slack.com](http://utahdata.slack.com).

Finally, if you're a member of our group and would like to post content you have created, please reach out to us on the Slack channel and we'll make that happen.
