Well hello there.  You've found us.  A blog.  (Yet another blog?)  No, a BLOG!

Who did you find?  [Utah County Data Science Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Utah-County-Data-Science-Meetup/).

What did you find?  A place where we can share some of the insights we're creating.  It is a site where we can identify and solve problems.  It is a site where we can have our work and practice live out loud.

So, it's kind of a neat site.

Of course, as you can see, this is the beginning.  We have blog articles we'll import into this system and we'll be encouraging our members to post some of their more-insightful pieces here as well.

If you're interested in data and learning from data, come join us.  We're a welcoming bunch, we typically have food at every meetup, and it's a good place to get started.

If you've been around the block more than once, come join us.  We're teaching and learning actively.  We like living this way.  We think you'll like it too.

If you're looking for smart people.  You found us.  Just read what we've created for you.

If there's any other reason for you to visit us, welcome.  As long as you're nice and respectful, you can expect the same here.
