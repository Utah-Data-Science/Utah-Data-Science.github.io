Last night we had a Meetup for the [Utah County Data Science](www.meetup.com/Utah-County-Data-Science-Meetup/).
Our presenter was the majestic Dave Richards. He gathered us around and had us
do some exploration on several gun violence type data sets.

One thing that I found interesting was a data set about mass shootings from 2014 to 2016.
One thing that was very striking to me was how much bigger the Orlando shooting
was than any other event that has happened in a while. I found this by creating
a scatterplot of the number of people killed vs injured.

It seems to me that more people get injured than killed in mass shootings. It
would have been helpful to show how many occurrences each of these dots represents.
I have a feeling it is hiding some of the information from us.

This graph made it super apparent just how tragic the Orlando shooting really was.
I didn't even realize that so many people had been injured. It's very unfortunate
that this happened.

Here is the [dataset](datasets/mass-shootings-2014-to-2016.csv) if you are interested in doing some of your own discovery.
